### ðŸŽ¨ Beyond Code
When I'm not coding, you can find me playing the piano, composing music, hitting the gym, or lost in a good book. I love the process of bringing ideas to life, whatever the medium.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about code, music, or anything in between!

Take care!
